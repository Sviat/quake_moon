Naming
------
Original was a very early beta and had many issues with consistency.
Project MOON, Moon Rizing, Project Moon Rizing ... just MOON.
Mod's name in different places (even inside on file) may be referred differently, but common part was always MOON, which is how I'm going to call it.

ReProject was done for ReRelease hence its name, if anybody asks.

Installation and Launch Instructions
------------------------------------
ReProject MOON targets Steam version of Quake 1, also known as Q1 ReRelease (based on Kex engine).

To play this mod, you dont need to do much:
1. Obtain copy of mod package
2. Extract to the `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\`
3. Launch game through Steam (it is guaranteed to work only on Kex engine so far)
4. Type in console `exec moon.cfg`


Mod Description
---------------
Project MOON was an unique modification for Quake1. ReProject aims to bring this awesome mod to the modern engine and closer to the wider audience.
Mod is best described as Hero Tower Defense FPS. The point of the game is to survive...

Human players play together in team. The only supported map in mod so far is the Castle which they have to defend.
Deep into the fortress you can find a room with the Heart of the castle.
In essence, the Heart is what exactly needs to be defended. If it is destroyed - the game is over.

The castle gate opens into a courtyard that has two caves in it, from which the monsters come from.
First they try to smash the gate, then they go to the the Heart and destroy it.

Not everything in the game is given for free. Weapons, ammo, armor, etc, you can buy in the shop.
Each item has different price. Moreover there is a "black market", where salesman sell "low quality" goods, for instance, "partialy-damaged" armor or "slightly-used megahealth".
Naturally, prices for such goods are much lower than in usual market.

It is possible to find gold in a sacks which falls out of monsters.
Also you can find it digging the "mine", which is periodically throws out sacks with gold if somebody stands near it.

After killing monsters players get experience. When the player gets enough experience points he "reaches next level".
By doing so he gets skill points for distribution, which he can spend on stats like vitality or strength.
With vitality increase - hit points increase, with strength - damage.

Monsters:
Their logic process has completely changed, therefore they are not in the same condition even though saved original appearance.
Monsters shoot much better now. If you peek out from around a corner and then hide again, the monster will shoot at the spot where it last saw you.
This is real artificial intelligence. There are plenty of monsters variants, i.e unique monsters(e.g. with quad damage or extra fast).

Items:
In addition to the usual items, sometimes the monsters fall out of magic items (armor or rings), 
which are not armor in the usual sense, but have magical properties. For instance, "Viper ring. +15 to max health".
Also you can find books of different titles, that give various boni.
When player's level rises, monsters improve too, so game grows more and more difficult.
When Castle levels-up, the guardian bot joins the game. It helps team to defend the Castle.
Amount of his hitpoints and his weapon set also changes with levels.



Setup Controls \ Console commands
-------------------------------------
Nota bene:
Project MOON's special commands can't be changed from Quake settings menu.
You have to use configs and/or console.

ReProject MOON's console commands all prefixed with `pm`. Base command to start with is `pm_help`.
Some commands are reserved for server Host, they are marked with `pms_`.
Commands that change things for players own view are marked with `pmc_`.
All commands are just aliases for impulse codes. Using `pm_help` command, one can see exact impulse code listed in left most column.

List of most important aliases:
(Console User Interface)
* `pm_character` - show summary, which includes Hearts HP, Player's Experience progress and carried Gold.
* `pm_stats` - show Player's character skils (Strength, Vitality etc) and number of unspent skill points.
* `pm_inventory` - show Player's equipment (magic armor and ring), plus status effects (like active drugs)
(Interaction with the World)
* `pm_identify` - trigger surroundings check for items that have special properties in MOON.
* `pm_buy` - trigger surroundings check for anything to sale, and buy it if Gold allows.
* `pm_use` - trigger surroundings check for Magical items to wear (magic armors and rings)
* `pm_skill1` (`pm_skill2`) - raise character's Vitality (skill1) or Strength (skill2) by 1 point

To (re-)assign key for a command, type the following text at the quake console:
```
	...
	(syntax: unbind <key>) to remove previous assignments, and not stack on top
	(syntax: bind <key> <command>) to add new alias to key
	unbindkey c
	bind c pm_character
	unbindkey i
	bind i pm_inventory
	...
```

Easiest way:
I've included already configured config file with distribution called `moon.cfg`, feel free to modify relevant part of it or create a new one.

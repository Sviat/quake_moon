-----------------------------

ver 0.29kf
- Changed how weapons work, reload, shoot, damage...internally. From player's PoV should not be noticeable
	- Only noticeable change is order of weapon switching when bought or picked up
		- RL and GL are considered dangerous, and should not automatically appear in some cases (i.e, when running out of batteries)
- Added Book upgrades for all types of Ammo
	- Previously only Bullets (Shells) and Nails had one
	- Now Rockets and Cells have too
		- Check out this amazing Cell upgrade! You will like it
	- Honored mention - Axe, which is upgradeable, but code is not finished yet, so you probably will not use it anyway [v>=0.32]
- Adjusted "Speed Mentat" buff as well
	- It is actually planned for deprecation or rework [v>=0.30]
	- New version planned to buff player speed instead
	- All mentats planned to have different debuffs on expiration, that can be healed by consuming any new mentat [v>=0.31]
- Added two new magical item traits
	- One to repair (non-magical) armor up to some value
	- Other to recharge cells up to some value as well
- Magical item properties are more random and should appear earlier
	- Previously there was linear loot table where each trait was repeated several times with higher quality. Spawn chance was locked by level ranges.
	- Now, exact effect and its power are generated independently from each other
	- This is true for both prefix- and postfix-traits.
	- Some effects still should not spawn before (and some not after) certain level.
		- Early-game-only traits are extra health and extra gold
		- Late-game-only are 2 new traits plus health regen and vampirism
	- Added rarity levels that some traits were missing
- Added personal touch to Guardian bots
	- Now before you send them rockets flying please at least check their name to press "F" later
	- May be in the future they will collect unpicked weapons in the fields [v>=0.35]

ver 0.28kf
- Added display of HP for players, bots and Heart
- Difficulty level now also influences the monster quantity
- Guardians now slowly regenerate health
- Counting spawned and killed monsters fixed
	- When you occasionally see that you killed less monsters than were spawned, yet nobody is attacking, thats because they are gathering on their spawn for the final wave

ver 0.27kf
- First version to at least somehow work anywhere except KEX (on FTE)
- First version to appear at the Quake Enhanced Add-on Server mod repository
- Mechanically not very different from 0.26k, but has better technical state
- Fixed player count counting

ver 0.26k
- Added display of item names in the store and black market, just like the names of players, guardian bots and monsters used to be shown before
- During Moon Shake, the mine now works on its own
- Rebalanced item refresh time in the store
	- Ammo from 24 to 40 seconds (with more players than 1, the refresh time is even shorter)
	- Medkits from 12 to 40 seconds
	- Weapons from 24 to 50 seconds
- Added code for future functionality of automatic distribution of skill points when leveling up.
- Unified more messages in CUI from different objects.

- Known issues:
	- When playing over the internet, messages from bots in chat do not come through

ver 0.25k
- Major change: now monster waves scale with number of players (the more, the merier)
	- It is not decided if Experience in future will be split between, currently it is granted to all
- Added new server-side command `pms_noshake` to disable Moonquakes
- Fix weapon ammo counter bugging sometimes

ver 0.24k
- Full clean, rewrite, refactor and modernization of all mod's code
- Adapted to Steam version of Quake 1 ReRelease, Kex Engine 4.0 Bastet
	- Minimal number of gameplay logic changes, mostly bug fixes and parametrization
- All ancient style Quake-glyphs used in old code and now broken in Kex replaced with normal text, red text and golden digits
- Optimized all Console User Interface (CUI) prints
- Added code for future Magic stats (Sanity and Intuition), potions and effects
- All books and elixirs are renamed for good old fun
- Friendly Bots are now properly using Kex chat; also they are marked when aiming at
- Unified all sources of HP and Damage amplification, now it is consistent and ready for future
- Split "Global" level from Player's level. This is preparation to make proper multiplayer lobbies with Hotjoin
- Renamed all aliases and remapped impulses to the range of 32-223, type "pm_help" in Q1 console to get full list with actual impulse values
- Reworked `sv_fastmeat` into `pms_fastmeat` and `pms_slowmeat`
	- Now they actually control creep wave spawn rate (guess which is which)

- Gameplay changes:
	- Friendly Bots now trained to dig gold
	- Any consequent Book of Red Alert after first will give +10 max HP to the Gate
	- Any consequent Book of Shell Shock (Shotguns mastery) after first will increase max shells capacity by 10
	- Any consequent Book of Nail Polish (Nailguns mastery) after first will increase max nails capacity by 20
